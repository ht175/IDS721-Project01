## Introduction
In this project, I build a command line tool by using rust to analyze the movie data.
Firstly, I read csv file from command line and convert it to dataframe.
Then I use dataframe to do several analysis about movie.

## Command to run
cargo run -- movie-analyze -- file-name <filename>
